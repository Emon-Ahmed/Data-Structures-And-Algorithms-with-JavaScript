  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs
  - Heaps

### 2. **Algorithm**

- Key algorithms explained with JavaScript code, including:
  - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming Examples (Knapsack Problem, Fibonacci Sequence, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Backtracking

### 3. **LeetCode Problems and Solutions**

- A collection of curated LeetCode problems categorized by topic.
- JavaScript solutions with step-by-step explanations.
- Best practices and optimization techniques.

### 4. **Guides and References**
